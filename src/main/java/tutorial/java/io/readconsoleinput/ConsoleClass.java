 *
 * 3. Using Console Class
 * It has been becoming a preferred way for reading userâ€™s input from the command line, Introduced in JDK 1.6. In addition, it
 * can be used for reading password-like input without echoing the characters entered by the user; the format string syntax can
 * also be used (like System.out.printf()).
 *
 * Advantages:
 * - Reading password without echoing the entered characters.
 * - Reading methods are synchronized.
 * - Format string syntax can be used.
 * - Does not work in non-interactive environment (such as in an IDE).
