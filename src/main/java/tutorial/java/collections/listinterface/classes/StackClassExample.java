 *
 * Java Collection framework provides a Stack class that models and implements a Stack data structure. The class is based on the
 * basic principle of LIFO(last-in-first-out). In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more
 * functions of empty, search, and peek.
 * The Stack class extends Vector and provides additional functionality specifically for stack operations, such as push, pop,
 * peek, empty, and search.
 * The Stack class can indeed be referred to as a subclass of Vector, inheriting its methods and properties.
