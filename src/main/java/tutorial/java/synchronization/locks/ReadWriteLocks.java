 *
 * A lock is a device for commanding access to an assigned resource by multiple threads. Usually, a lock grants exclusive access
 * to a shared resource: just one thread at a flash can acquire the lock and everyone accesses to the shared resource requires
 * that the lock be acquired first. Though, some locks may allow side-by-side access to a shared resource, as the read lock of
 * a ReadWriteLock.
 * ReadWriteLock is an interface. ReadWriteLock is implemented by ReentrantReadWriteLock Class which is in
 * java.util.concurrent.locks package. So, to use a ReadWriteLock we have to use ReentrantReadWriteLock.
 * A java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock is a high-level thread lock tool. It allows various threads to read a specific
 * resource but allows only one to write it, at a time.
 * The approach is, that multiple threads can read from a shared resource without causing concurrency errors. The concurrency
 * errors first occur when writes and reads to a shared resource occur simultaneously, or if multiple writes take place simultaneously.
 *
 * Rules:
 * Read lock and Write lock which allows a thread to lock the ReadWriteLock either for reading or writing.
 * - Read lock: If there is no thread that has requested the write lock and the lock for writing, then multiple threads can lock
 * the lock for reading. It means multiple threads can read the data at the very moment, as long as thereâ€™s no thread to write
 * the data or to update the data.
 * - Write Lock: If no threads are writing or reading, only one thread at a moment can lock the lock for writing. Other threads
 * have to wait until the lock gets released. It means, only one thread can write the data at the very moment, and other threads
 * have to wait.
