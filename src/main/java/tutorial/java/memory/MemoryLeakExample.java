 * Java does automatic Garbage collection. However there can be situations where garbage collector does not collect objects
 * because there are references to them. There might be situations where an application creates lots of objects and does not use
 * them. Just because every objects has valid references, garbage collector in Java canâ€™t destroys the objects. Such types of
 * useless objects are called as Memory leaks. If allocated memory goes beyond limit, program will be terminated by rising
 * OutOfMemoryError. Hence if an object is no longer required, it is highly recommended to make that object eligible for garbage
 * collector. Otherwise We should use some tools that do memory management to identifies useless objects or memory leaks like:
 *
 * HP OVO
 * HP J METER
 * JProbe
 * IBM Tivoli
